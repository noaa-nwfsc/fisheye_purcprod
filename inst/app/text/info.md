## About the app


::: {style="font-size:1.2em;"}
This Shiny App (built in R) is a tool that was developed to assist the
Economic Data Collection (EDC) program at the
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center" target="_blank">Northwest
Fisheries Science Center</a> make its economic data available to the
public. It aggregates, summarizes, and compares various facets of this
data pertaining to the purchase and production of the West Coast
Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program.

The data presented here were collected through the EDC program from
shorebased processors that purchase bottom groundfish, midwater
groundfish, and Pacific hake from catcher vessels participating in the
West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share program. It includes all fish
caught under the program, as well as additional species purchased by
these facilities.

Data collection is conducted annually as required by
<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-VI/part-660/subpart-D/section-660.114" target="_blank">regulation
50 CFR 660.114</a>. A First Receiver Site License (FRSL) authorizes a
buyer to receive, purchase, or take possession of an Individual Fishing
Quota (IFQ) landing at a specific onshore location. Each buyer must hold
an FRSL for every site where IFQ landings are offloaded.

### Using the app

<br>

The **Overview** page provides a broad look the production value and
weight of species across years. In the top left hand corner, use the
**Select a year** drop down to filter data to a single year that you are
wanting to investigate. You can then compare this to the average across
a range of years or another single year in the **Select a date range**
slider below. By clicking and dragging the slider, you can adjust the
date range. If you want to compare to a single year, drag both ends of
the date range onto the same year so that only one single year is
selected.

The **Explore the Data** page provides a more granular look at metrics,
statistics, and other variables related to the data and how they change
over time. Data can be viewed as a summary, by product type, or by
species. Filtered data can be downloaded using the **DOWNLOAD** button
at the bottom of the left hand side panel. Data can be viewed both as a
time series plot or in tabular form using the **Plot** and **Table**
panels on the right hand side.

### Data Caveats and Details


::: {style="font-size:1.2em;"}
The data included in this app only includes purchase and production
information for shorebased first receivers and seafood processors.
Please visit the [Pacific whiting
app](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/Whiting/) for detailed
information about all three sectors (shorebased, mothership, and
catcher-processor).

**Species groupings:**

For individual species labeling purposes, the group labeled "Other species" 
includes California halibut, Pacific halibut, Sturgeon, Pacific herring, 
Squid, and Echinoderms. "Other groundfish species" includes English sole, 
Lingcod, Rex sole, Sharks, skates and rays, Arrowtooth flounder, and Sanddab.

For processors, production information is collected on the EDC form at
the species level. Data are reported in Fisheye in three distinct
categories of production activities: “Pacific whiting production,”
“Non-whiting groundfish production,” and “Other species production.” Two
aggregate categories of production activities are also reported: “All
production” (aggregate of Pacific whiting, non-whiting groundfish, and
other species) and “Groundfish production” (aggregate of Pacific whiting
and non-whiting groundfish). “Non-whiting groundfish production”
includes arrowtooth flounder, Dover sole, English sole, lingcod, Pacific
sanddab,petrale sole, rex sole, rockfish, sablefish (black cod),
thornyheads, and sharks, skates, and rays. “Other species production”
includes coastal pelagics (including sardines and mackerel), crab,
echinoderms (including sea urchins and sea cucumbers), California
halibut, Pacific halibut, Pacific herring, salmon, squid, sturgeon,
tuna, other shellfish, and other species.

**Company size:**

Shorebased processors are grouped into three size classes based on the
number of\
production employees: Large (\>200 workers), Medium (100–200 workers),
and Small\
(\<100 workers).

::: {style="font-size:1.2em;"}
**Region:**

Processors are grouped by region based on the location of each
processor. Two regions are recognized: Washington and Oregon, and
California. Washington and Oregon are combined to protect the
confidentiality of the data.
